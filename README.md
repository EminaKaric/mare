# Project Description
FIM/MIM R2 MA Rules Extension Framework (hereafter FIM.MARE) is a framework for use with Management Agents in Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 (FIM2010 R2) or Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM2016). 

It enables FIM administrators to, declaratively, create advanced [flow rules](flow-rule) with a vast number of [transform functions](transforms) and even [conditions](conditions) for FIM2010 R2. This framework can be used as a replacement for Synchronization Rules (SR's) or as a supplement to these by using the FIM Synchronization Service to [setup](installing-and-configuring) the advanced rules.

FIM.MARE reads declared flow rules from an XML [configuration file](Structure of the configuration file) which contains information about the management agent rules available.
